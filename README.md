# :bookmark_tabs: Classification Methods - Student Performance Dataset

## :mag: 1. Project Overview & Dataset

This study has one main objective: develop and present a comprehensive exploration and implementation of various Classification methods, utilizing the Student Performance dataset to predict student academic success.

The dataset provides a comprehensive and realistic representation of various factors associated with student performance in an educational environment. It captures demographic details, family background, study habits, school-related characteristics, and academic scores across key subjects. The purpose of this dataset is to offer a structured and versatile resource for anyone interested in understanding patterns, behaviors, and influences that contribute to student outcomes.

The dataset includes rich information such as parental education, access to learning resources, attendance, study duration, extracurricular involvement, and preferred study methods. These aspects help outline a broader context of a student's academic journey, beyond mere scores. The subject-wise marks in Mathematics, Science, and English, along with a computed overall performance score and final grade, provide a complete view of student achievements.

This dataset can be used for:

Educational research Institutional planning and analysis Understanding learning behavior trends Examining the relationship between lifestyle and academic outcomes Exploratory studies on attendance, study habits, or parental background General-purpose data exploration and visualization

Because the data is synthetically generated, it avoids any privacy or ethical issues typically associated with student datasets. It reflects realistic patterns without containing personally identifiable information. The structure is designed to be clear, readable, and ready for analysis across all experience levels—from beginners exploring data for the first time to professionals conducting in-depth educational studies.
